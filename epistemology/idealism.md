# Idealism
*Epistemology*

Idealism is a theory of perception. It is the view that all immediate objects of perception are mind-dependent objects. Idealism claims that there is a physical world, but the physical objects that furnish it are mental, not material. Because idealism claims that all that exists are ideas, the implication of this is that objects do not exist when they are not being perceived.

* The physical world and its objects are perceived directly.
* The physical world is mind-dependent, constituted by ideas.

## Arguments for idealism

### The master argument
Bishop Berkeley, a prominent idealist, declared that "*esse est percipi*": to be is to be perceived. Because the external world does not depend on being perceived (it is mind-independent), Berkeley claims that it does not exist. Logically, a mind-independent world cannot exist if, 'to be', it *has* to be perceived. The master argument from Berkeley is critical in his rejection of an external world.

Berkeley reasons that when a physical object is thought about, it is thought of being perceived. Therefore, no one can think of anything that exists unperceived - it is self-contradictory to think of, and thus perceive, a tree existing unperceived. What is perceived is in the mind, so what is thought of is also in the mind. And as such, it is impossible to think of anything existing independently of the mind. The implication of this is that the physical world is constituted by ideas, there is no external world, and idealism is correct.

Critics of the master argument claim Berkeley conflates imagination and conception. It is argued that something can still be conceived of without strictly needing to imagine it and perceive it in the mind. For example, it is not impossible to conceive of a 1,000-sided shape; it still logically exists, despite it being hard to accurately imagine it. On the other hand, a four-sided triangle is inconceivable because its existence is self-contradictory.

### The primary/secondary quality distinction
The primary/secondary quality distinction is key in the theory of indirect realism; however, Berkeley attacks Locke's distinction and uses his attack as an argument for idealism. He claims that all qualities are perceiver-dependent because primary qualities (e.g., size) are also subject to perceptual variation and relativity. A giraffe and an ant might perceive the size of a tree differently. Although, this is not a strong criticism as it can still be logically counterargued that size can be objectively measured.

Moreover, Berkeley argues that all qualities are perceiver-dependent because primary qualities can only be accessed through secondary qualities. For example, the edges of a physical object can only be discerned visually through colour. The shape of the same object can also be identified tactually through touch. Locke claimed that secondary qualities were subjective and mental, so the argument from Berkeley nullifies the distinction between primary and secondary qualities.

However, this in itself does not prove that the external world does not exist, which is why is it is a considerably weaker argument for idealism than the master argument. Berkeley has not distinguished between ideas of qualities (sense-data) and the qualities themselves. There could still be a material substratum that causes perceptual experiences that is unperceived and mind-independent.

## The role of God 
Berkeley argues that all physical objects exist eternally in the mind of God and copies of these are perceived when God wills us to. Everyone accesses the same ideas and physical objects stored in the mind of God.

### Problems with the role of God

#### An ad hoc solution
Critics of idealism suggest that the involvement of God in the theory was on an ad hoc basis - it happened to be convenient for Berkeley and has no independent justification. It is also hypocritical if God is as unknowable as matter, considering God is not experienced directly and God cannot be thought of unperceived. However, given the complexity, order, manner, and predictability of perceptual experiences, Berkeley claims that only God can be the source of them. It cannot be ideas, because they in themselves have no power to cause experiences, and it cannot be the mind, otherwise perceptual experiences could be controlled.

#### The absence of sensations
Furthermore, it is argued that what is felt and perceived cannot be part of God's mind if he cannot feel sensations, such as pain. And because God's mind is said to be unchanging, how can it be that objects and ideas change and cease to exist? Berkeley, however, rebukes this criticism of idealism by clarifying perceptual experiences are merely copies of God's ideas, which are understandings and not sensations. God doesn't feel pain when you do, but he is aware of the pain because the idea of it is being accessed by you.

## Arguments against idealism

### Argument from illusion and hallucination
Idealism does not make a distinction between appearance and reality. The issue is that it is impossible to discern illusions and hallucinations from veridical perception if all that is perceived is sense-data. Illusions and hallucinations could appear to be subjectively indistinguishable from reality, which is a problem for idealism.

The response from idealism is that illusions and hallucinations as perceptual experiences are less vivid than veridical perception. For example, a pencil in water might appear to be bent, but its straightness can still be confirmed if the pencil is touched while it is partly submerged. This contradiction between the senses makes the experience less vivid. Additionally, illusions and hallucinations are inconsistent with other experiences, and, if nothing else, they can be identified retrospectively because they do not correspond with typical perceptual experiences.

### Idealism can lead to solipsism
Solipsism is the view that all one can know is one's own mind. Idealism can lead to solipsism because everything that is known is from experience, which is just sense-data and mind-dependent. However, the response from idealism is that it is known that the mind of God also exists, since what is perceived are copies of God's ideas when he wills us to perceive them. It can also be known that different people perceive the same physical world, as everyone accesses the same copies of God's ideas.
