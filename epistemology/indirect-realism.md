# Indirect realism
*Epistemology*

Indirect realism is a theory of perception. It is the view that the immediate objects of perception are mind-dependent objects (sense-data) that are caused by and represent mind-independent objects. Sense-data represent physical objects in the external world. In application, we know what the external world is like by inference from sense-data - it is evidence for what exists.

* There is both a physical world and an external world.
* Sense-data are an intermediary in the perception of the external world.

## Arguments for indirect realism

### Non-veridical perception
The arguments against direct realism can be used in support of indirect realism. Illusions, hallucinations, perceptual variation, and time-lag are all examples of non-veridical perception that cannot be explained by naïve direct realism. Because the implication of direct realism is that appearance and reality are identical, these arguments claim that the immediate objects of perception has to be sense-data or other mind-dependent objects. Indirect realism is able to use sense-data to explain how illusions, hallucinations, and so forth are experiences that misrepresent the external world.

### The primary/secondary quality distinction
Primary qualities are intrinsic to and inseparable from objects. Examples include extension, shape, motion, number, and solidity - they are all objectively measurable. Primary qualities can be accessed through multiple senses and the perceptual experiences (sense-data) of primary qualities resemble the primary qualities of the objects themselves.

Secondary qualities represent objects, but do not necessarily resemble them. They cannot be objectively measured or otherwise quantified like primary qualities can. Colours, sounds, and tastes are all examples of secondary qualities. However, secondary qualities can only be accessed through one sense - colour corresponds to vision, sound corresponding to hearing, and so forth.

Locke argued for the existence of primary and secondary qualities. Qualities are powers that a physical object has to produce an image in the mind. Secondary qualities can also be considered as reactions to primary qualities, such as the feeling of 'hotness' or 'coldness' is the reaction to the temperature of an object. Because primary qualities are intrinsic to objects, they cannot exist without them - a physical object without shape or solidity is inconceivable.

## Arguments against indirect realism

### Argument from scepticism
The argument from scepticism is that, if it is only sense-data that we perceive, then we can only be certain that it is sense-data that exists and not the external world too. This is known as the 'veil of perception'. It is a problem for indirect realism, because the theory claims that sense-data is supposed to represent the external world.

#### Counterarguments from indirect realism

##### Locke: Involuntary nature of experience
Locke argues that we have control over the ideas we imagine, yet we have perceptual experiences whether we want them or not. As such, perceptual experiences must be produced in the mind by some mind-independent cause - physical objects. So, the mind-independent, external world must exist.

He illustrates this argument with the perception of light: you can close their eyes and choose to recall the idea of light, yet if you turn your eyes to the sky at noon you cannot avoid the idea of light being produced in you. The sensation is caused by something outside of yourself, and this indicates the existence of the external world.

##### Locke, Trotter Cockburn: Coherence of senses
Locke poses that, if the mind-independent world did not exist, it could not be explained how corresponding information can be obtained from different senses. It could also not be explained how, from a single perceptual experience in one sense, perceptual experiences in other senses can also be inferred. Moreover, Locke argues that there would be no explanation for the very complex interactions between actions and the perceptions they produce, too. Therefore, he argues there is good reason to believe in the existence of a mind-independent world.

Trotter Cockburn consolidated this argument by highlighting how senses corroborate one another. For example, if you see a fire nearby, the presence of said fire could be confirmed if your hand feels the heat when you put it near to it. All the different senses appear to give corresponding information about one and the same world.

She also notices the coherence of senses and perceptual experiences over time. That is to say, while experiences can vary greatly across the senses (seeing a dog bark and hearing the sound it makes), it can still be learnt over time to naturally associate these perceptual experiences with one another. This would not be possible, Trotter Cockburn claims, if the external world didn't exist.

##### Russell: Best hypothesis
Either mind-independent objects exist and cause sense-data, or they do not exist - neither claim can be proven to be true or false. So, Russell proposes that they are instead treated as hypotheses. However, he claims that the hypothesis that mind-independent objects exist, and cause sense-data, is far better than the alternative. This is a simple yet powerful claim because it matches the instinctive belief in a mind-independent world, and it can also explain why perceptual experiences behave in regular and predictable ways.

Russell uses a cat as a means of demonstrating his claim. You might see a cat first in the corner of a room and then, predictably, you see it on a chair. If the cat is a real, mind-independent object then it clearly walked from the corner to the chair when you weren't looking - this perfectly explains the difference in these two experiences. However, if the cat was only sense-data, then the implication of this is that it did not exist when you were not looking. It just sprang back into existence when you were looking. Thus, Russell argues that the existence of an external world is the best, most practical, and most sensible hypothesis.

### Argument from Berkeley
Bishop Berkeley also argues that the nature of mind-independent objects in the external world cannot be known because mind-dependent ideas cannot be like mind-independent objects. He argues that our ideas of primary qualities, like shape and size, derive from perceptual experience - he claims the only ideas we have of shape and size are the ones we experience (through touch, vision, etc.). There is nothing like a perceptual experience except another perceptual experience, so it cannot be said that sense-data are like or resemble mind-independent physical objects.

<blockquote>"The only thing an idea can resemble is another idea; [experience of] a colour or shape can’t be like anything but another [experience of] colour or shape. Attend a little to your own thoughts and you will find that you can’t conceive of any likeness except between your ideas." –Berkeley</blockquote>

Berkeley was a proponent of idealism.
