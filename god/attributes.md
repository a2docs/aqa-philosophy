# Attributes of God
*Metaphysics of God*

The God of Classical Theism is recognised as omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. There are also competing views on such a being's relationship to time, such as whether He is eternal and atemporal or everlasting and temporal.

## God's divine attributes

### Omnipotence

To be omnipotent is to be all-powerful. It can also be interpreted as the quality of being *perfectly* powerful. As He is omnipotent, it is not possible for there to exist a more powerful being than God.

### Omniscience

To be omniscient is to be all-knowing. It can also be interpreted as the quality of having *perfect* knowledge. The God of Classical Theism knows everything that can be known.

### Omnibenevolence

To be omnibenevolent is to be all-loving. It can also be interpreted as the quality of being *perfectly* loving. God always does what is morally right.

## God's relationship to time

If God is eternal, then He is atemporal and exists outside of time. Whereas, if God is everlasting, then He is temporal and exists inside of time.

### Eternal and atemporal

1. Everything in time changes.
2. But, God is immutable.
3. Therefore, God cannot be in time.
4. Therefore, God exists outside of time.

Note: it would logically follow that, for God, that 64 CE (or any other time, for that matter) exists with now, the present.

### Everlasting and temporal

1. God is without beginning and end.
2. God interacts with and has a personal connection with the world.
3. The world is temporal.
4. Any being that interacts with the temporal world is temporal.
5. Therefore, God is an everlasting being, existing in time.
