# Attributes of God
*Metaphysics of God*

The God of Classical Theism is recognised as omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. He is conceived of as being a supremely perfect being. There are also competing views on such a being's relationship to time, such as whether He is eternal and atemporal or everlasting and temporal.

## God's divine attributes

### Omnipotence

To be omnipotent is to be all-powerful. It can also be interpreted as the quality of being *perfectly* powerful. As He is omnipotent, it is not possible for there to exist a more powerful being than God.

### Omniscience

To be omniscient is to be all-knowing. It can also be interpreted as the quality of having *perfect* knowledge. The God of Classical Theism knows everything that can be known.

### Omnibenevolence

To be omnibenevolent is to be all-loving. It can also be interpreted as the quality of being *perfectly* loving. God always does what is morally right.

## God's relationship to time

If God is eternal, then He is atemporal and exists outside of time. Whereas, if God is everlasting, then He is temporal and exists inside of time.

### Eternal and atemporal

1. Everything in time changes.
2. But God is immutable.
3. Therefore, God cannot be in time.
4. Therefore, God exists outside of time.

Note: it would logically follow that, for God, that 64 CE (or any other time, for that matter) exists with now, the present.

### Everlasting and temporal

1. God is without beginning and end.
2. God interacts with and has a personal connection with the world.
3. The world is temporal.
4. Any being that interacts with the temporal world is temporal.
5. Therefore, God is an everlasting being, existing in time.

## Contradictions

### The paradox of the stone

*Can God create a stone that He cannot lift?*

If He can, it would follow that He cannot lift the stone that He created. If He cannot, then He simply cannot create the stone. In either case, it would seem that there is something that God cannot do. And, if there is something God cannot do, it could be argued that He does not satisfy the definition of omnipotence.

We, as humans, can create objects that we cannot lift (for example, a large statue). As such, being able to make something that one cannot lift seems to be logically possible. With regards to these objects, it is only our own physical limits that prevent us from lifting them - if we were significantly stronger for some reason, perhaps we would be able to lift what we previously could not. So, being able to lift every stone is a logical possibility.

In response, it could be argued that the paradox fails to show God's power is limited in any way. Simply, God can create any stone that it is possible for God, as an omnipotent being, to make. A stone that God cannot lift is arguably logically impossible, so the fact that He cannot create it is not a limitation of His power. What is logically impossible means nothing and holds no weight in the universe, so God's omnipotence is not questioned when He cannot do something that is logically impossible.

### Omniscience and free will

*How can humans have free will and God be omniscient simultaneously?*

As humans, we generally believe that we have the capacity to choose our own course of action unimpeded. That is to say, we have free will. However, if God is omniscient (specifically, all-knowing) then His knowledge includes everything. And if He knows *everything*, then it would follow that He already knows what will happen in the future. Therefore, He knows what we will do in the future and what our course of action will be.

But, if God knows this, it would appear as though our actions are pre-determined. So, it would seem that, to be able to believe in the existence of an omniscient being (such as God), one must resign one's concept of their own free will. Conversely, for one to believe they have free will, one cannot believe in the existence of an omniscient being.

In response, theists could argue that if God was eternal then His knowledge of what we will do is not before we do it. Instead, it will all be at the same time for an atemporal being. Therefore, we could remain free to choose our own course of action unimpeded. Simultaneously, nothing we ever do will be outside God's knowledge - He is aware of all events and temporal phenomena simultaneously. However, this response is predicated on the belief that God is atemporal.

Determinism is the philosophical view that all events are ultimately determined by pre-existing, external causes. A response might stem from hard determinism that argues determinism, from which it derives, is true and so human free will does not exist. And so, if it doesn't exist, there is no incompatibility between free will and God's omniscience. However, this response is highly unlikely to be compelling for theists.

Bear in mind that we as humans could be under the illusion of free will and know no better.

### The Euthyphro dilemma

*Does God command what is good because it is good, or is what is good good because God commands it?*

* If the former is true, how can God be omnipotent? If what is good is independent of God's control or influence then it may be difficult to describe God as omnipotent.
* If the latter is true, how can God be omnibenevolent? In this case, it would seem that morality is arbitrary. It may be difficult to describe God as omnibenevolent when He could command torture and it be good, therefore. 

In response, it could be argued that it is logically impossible for God to command what is evil but that this is not a detriment to his power. If torture is wrong then God could no more command torture than create a four-sided triangle. However, whether these moral judgements are necessary truths is disputable.

Alternatively, theists could argue that morality does indeed depend on God but that God and goodness are distinct concepts. Nonetheless, God's will always coincides with what is good. That and God are both referring to the same thing: morality. God's will is conditioned by His love but this does not constitute a constraint upon it. God's love is part of His perfection. And because God is divinely perfect, He will always command what is good. Nothing, even the good, has an existence independent of God.
